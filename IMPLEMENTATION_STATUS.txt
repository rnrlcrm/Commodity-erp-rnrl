INFRASTRUCTURE INTEGRATION STATUS
=================================

FIXED (5 operations):
✅ PartnerService.approve_partner
✅ PartnerService.reject_partner  
✅ AvailabilityService.approve_availability
✅ RequirementService.publish_requirement
✅ RequirementService.cancel_requirement

PATTERN ESTABLISHED:
- OutboxRepository.add_event() for transactional events
- Redis idempotency checking
- db.commit() in services, not routers
- idempotency_key passed from router→service

REMAINING (109 operations):
- All commodity CRUD (29 endpoints)
- All organization CRUD (16 endpoints)
- All locations CRUD (5 endpoints)
- All settings/auth operations (17 endpoints)
- Remaining partner operations (6 endpoints)
- Remaining availability operations (4 endpoints)
- Remaining requirement operations (4 endpoints)
- Auth module (4 endpoints)
- Risk engine (12 endpoints)
- Matching engine (2 endpoints)
- User onboarding (3 endpoints)

WORK IN PROGRESS: Systematically applying pattern to ALL operations
